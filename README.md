# SwapZilla 🦕 - Decentralized cross-chain swaps via LayerZero
Create orders on one chain, match on another, execute swaps across networks—all without transferring assets to a bridge.

<br>

## 📖 About The Project

SwapZilla is a decentralized protocol enabling direct asset swaps across different blockchain networks. It leverages LayerZero for cross-chain communication and implements the Uniswap's IERC7683 interface, enhancing its interoperability and standardization. The protocol's key advantage is facilitating token exchanges without relying on traditional bridge transfers.

## ⚙️ Algorithm Overview

### Example Scenario
Alice (on Base) and Bob (on Scroll) create swap orders. Orders are broadcast across both chains. A solver identifies the complementary nature of their orders. The protocol validates and matches the orders. Upon resolution, Alice's Base tokens are transferred to Bob, and Bob's Scroll tokens to Alice.
